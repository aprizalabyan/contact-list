### A simple web-app to implement CRUD operations
- No back-end
- Using json-server for local API
- Can add, edit, or delete data
- Just works on local server

\
Configurations
- First run API server `json-server --watch dbAPI.json`
- Then `npm start` to run the apps
- Data in `dbAPI.json` dynamically changes based on operations

\
If you want an online server example, switch to `spreadsheet-api` branch

\
Made with React & Bootstrap as framework.\
Also use plugins such as Json-server, Axios, Uid and Iconify to support this web-app.
